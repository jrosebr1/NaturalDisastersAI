Act as both (1) an expert meteorologist and (2) an expert data scientist.

Below you'll find a comma separated list of {locations} that a given tornado was recorded in. These locations could consist of state names, cities, counties, townships, or regions. 

The {locations} data is imperfect, and there may be typos. Do your best to infer the correct names of the locations.

Your job is to take these locations and fill the {output template} JSON variable with the unique names of each state the comma-separated list of locations maps to. When naming the states, use their two letter codes rather than the full name.

In some cases, you may be unable to determine the name of the state from the input. In that case, simply ignore the string that could not be converted into a proper state name.

Locations:
{{ locations }}

Output Template (JSON variable):
{
	"states": []
